AIM:
Hello World and Calculator program

SOTWARE USED:
VS Code

THEORY:
Theory:
The "Hello World" program is the simplest C++ program that displays a message on the screen. It is used to demonstrate the basic structure and syntax of a C++ program.

Key Concepts Introduced:
Preprocessor directives (#include)

Namespace (std)

Main function (int main())

Output using cout

Syntax of statements and semicolons

This program introduces students to compiling and running a C++ program, and helps verify that their development environment is correctly set up.

A calculator program in C++ performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This program helps demonstrate:

Input from the user using cin

Use of decision-making structures like switch or if-else

Use of arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /

CONCLUSION:
In this experiment, we successfully implemented a simple "Hello World" program and a  basic calculator program in C++. The program takes two numbers and an operator as input from the user and performs the corresponding arithmetic operation. This experiment helped us understand how to use user input, switch-case decision structures, and arithmetic operations in C++ programs.
